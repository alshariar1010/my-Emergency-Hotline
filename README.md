1. The differences between getElementById and getElementsByClassName and querySelector are:
getElementById: It selects the element with a specific ID from the DOM.

getElementsByClassName: It selects all elements with a specific class and name.

querySelector: Returns the first matching element according to the CSS selector style.

querySelectorAll: Returns all matching elements from the DOM as a node list using the CSS selector.

2.
If a new element needs to be created, document.createElement() must be written.

3. Event bubbling is an event handling process where an event first occurs in its own element and then it gradually spreads to its parent elements.

4. Event delegation is a method where only one event listener is placed on the parent element so that events that occur in its child elements can also be captured.

5.preventDefault(): This stops the default browser action for any event.

stopPropagation(): This stops the bubble process for any event.
